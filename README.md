# Thesis
This repository contains my computer science thesis for the year 2022/2023. 
The purpose of this project is to develop an application that simplifies Logical Circuits using 3 different algorithms: Boolean, Karnaugh, Quine-McCluskey(Tabulation)

# Execution
To execute the application, follow these steps:

1.Open the project folder in an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

2.Build and compile the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

3.Run the application using the provided execution command or the IDE's built-in tools.

# Usage
For instructions on how to use the application, please refer to Chapter 3, Section 4 of my thesis paper. 
This chapter provides detailed documentation on the functionality and features of the application. 
It will guide you through the process of utilizing the different components and understanding the underlying concepts.

# Known Issues
Please note that the Karnaugh and Tabulation classes will not currently function as expected due to the presence of multiple issues. 
Although the logic behind the code is sound, these issues prevent the application from producing the desired output. 
The Boolean class also has slight issues, some particular inputs may return an error.
I'm still attempting to fix these problems.

Feel free to explore the remaining parts of the application and refer to other sections of the thesis paper for additional information.

Best regards,
Roberto Tarta
